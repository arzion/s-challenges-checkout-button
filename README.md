To improve the **CheckoutHandler** in an eCommerce microservices setup, we should ensure that each responsibility is handled independently, simplifying the `CheckoutHandler` itself. The following approach achieves this by focusing on separating concerns and managing non-critical operations asynchronously:

### Proposed Solution

1. **Use a Message Queue for Non-Critical Tasks**:
   - **Email** and **SMS notifications** should be handled asynchronously via a message queue, such as **RabbitMQ**. Since these tasks do not require strict ordering or persistent storage, RabbitMQ fits well.
   - **Justification**: By offloading notifications to a message queue, the `CheckoutHandler` remains focused on the primary task, improving system performance and reliability.

2. **Ensure Payment Completes Before Notifications**:
   - **Payment Submission** should occur synchronously within the `CheckoutHandler` to guarantee the transaction’s success.
   - Only after a successful payment confirmation should the system enqueue notification events (email and SMS) for further processing.

3. **Handle Event Publishing Failures Gracefully**:
   - Track any issues in publishing events to the message queue (e.g., network failures or queue unavailability).
   - Optionally, **implement a retry mechanism** for failed notifications or log them for future reprocessing, depending on the use case.
   - **Justification**: Notifications are non-critical, so we don’t need to roll back the payment if notification publishing fails. Instead, logging or retrying can mitigate the risk without disrupting user experience or critical workflows.

### Explanation of Choices

- **Message Queue**: Using RabbitMQ helps distribute tasks independently, allowing each microservice to handle one specific function (email or SMS) without impacting the checkout flow. If strict ordering or persistence were required, **Kafka** might be a better option, but for this case, RabbitMQ is sufficient.
- **Transactional Integrity**: By confirming the payment first, we ensure the primary business function is completed before attempting secondary actions like notifications.

This approach minimizes coupling, ensures the checkout handler does only one critical task, and enables resilient, scalable processing for non-critical tasks.
